### Data Source :bulb:

ðŸ§©[BioGRID](https://thebiogrid.org/)

BioGRID is one of the main source of interaction data in our project. Besides, the interaction validation data, including the PubMed IDs of the articles verifying the interactions and the experimental methods, is provided by BioGRID.

ðŸ§© [STRING](https://string-db.org/)

The STRING database also provides a large amount of interaction data. Unlike BioGRID, it primarily provides interaction scores based on experiments and predictions, which indicate the reliability of a given interaction. The final interactions shown in our database are an intersection of the two databases mentioned above. Additionally, we use protein sequences from the STRING database when structure files are unavailable for certain proteins. Furthermore, we retrieve protein aliases and corresponding tertiary structure names from the STRING database to facilitate cross-database searches and conversions.

ðŸ§© [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/)

We obtain the download URLs for protein tertiary structure files from the PDB database. The tertiary structure from PDB database is obtained from experiment, including X-ray Crystallography, NMR Spectroscopy, Cryo-EM, etc. So when we are collecting tertiary structure data for each protein, data from PDB database is given the top priority.

ðŸ§© [AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)

The AlphaFold database provides over 200 million protein structure predictions generated by AlphaFold model. When experimental structures cannot be retrieved from the PDB database, we prioritize searching the AlphaFold database to obtain the download URL for predicted structures. Additionally, we extract sequences and secondary structures from the `.cif` files provided by the AlphaFold database to ensure correspondence between the secondary structures and sequences.

ðŸ§© [SWISS-MODEL](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/)

SWISS-MODEL is a fully automated protein structure homology-modelling server. When valid tertiary structures cannot be obtained from the previous two databases, we manually supplement them using SWISS-MODEL.

ðŸ§© [MyGene.info](https://mygene.info/)

MyGene.info can be used to quickly retrieve functional annotations for each gene, specifically GO terms.

ðŸ§© [Gene Oncology](https://geneontology.org/)

The Gene Ontology database provides detailed information about GO terms. In this project, we obtained the GO term information files from the Gene Ontology database and extracted the interaction relationships between different GO terms.

:pushpin: `Ecoli_protein_go` & `Scer_protein_go` table

These two tables provide information about the functional annotation (which is GO term in our database) of each protein in *E. coli* and *S. cerevisiae*. One `protein_id` may have more than one record if it has several GO terms.

:pushpin: `Ecoli_secondary_structure` & `Scer_secondary_structure` table

These two tables provide secondary structure for each corresponding protein. The secondary structure is given in string format and presented as "C", "H", T", or "B", in which "H" represents helix, "T" represents turn, "B" represents bend, and "C" represents the other remaining secondary structure, which mainly contains beta sheet.

The secondary structure sequence corresponds one-to-one with the primary structure sequence. The information is taken from the predicted tertiary structure files in `.cif` format by a package developed by ourselves. The tertiary structures are got from Alpha Fold database. There are some missing values, which we can't get tertiary structure files or extract secondary structure successfully.

:pushpin: `Ecoli_tertiary_structure` & `Scer_tertiary_structure` table

These two tables provide download URL for tertiary structure of each corresponding protein. Proteins are first searched in the PDB database for tertiary structures. If no structure is found, the predicted structure is retrieved from the Alpha Fold database. The remaining proteins are supplemented using the SWISS-MODEL database. There are some missing values, which tertiary structure can't be obtained from the three databases above.

| Column Name | Data Type                             | Constraints                                                  | Description                       |

* Notes:

  * Case Insensitivity: The letters in protein IDs of E.coli will be automatically normalized to lowercase, while the letters in protein IDs of S.cerevisiae will be automatically normalized to uppercase.

  * Interaction Graph: The `graph_svg` field contains an SVG string representing the interaction network. The graph includes proteins that interact with the query protein, as well as interactions between these proteins. The thickness of the edges represents the interaction score, with thicker edges indicating higher scores. An example is given below:

### Download API Design :envelope_with_arrow:

Through this API, users can download all interaction data for a specific species (including interacting proteins, scores, literature references, and validation experiments), as well as the GO annotations of the proteins involved in the interactions.

* Endpoint: `GET/download`

* Request Parameters:

  | Parameter | Data Type | Required | Description                                                  |
  | --------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `species` | `string`  | Yes      | The name of the species. Accepted values are E`.coli` and `S.cerevisiae`. |

* Example Request URL:

  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/download?species=S.cerevisiae
  ```

* Download files:

  Data is given in `.csv` format, including the following columns:

  | protein_a                     | protein_b                     | interaction_score               | experiment_approach                                       | pubmed_id                            | GO_a                       | GO_b                       |
